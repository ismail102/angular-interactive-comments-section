This will force higher learning to compete for customers, aka students. Many institutions will not make it. The slow fix is to identify institutions that demonstrate freedom and send your kids there. Again, this will force institutions to compete for customers, but it will take more time to see results. Higher education is a business, not unlike Bud Light. Treat it accordingly if you want to make a point.",

A view of an electoral Map shows how much geographical space then leans conservative. the bottom line is that universities are capsizing over this. if they don't stop with the extreme politics and figure out what people actually gain from higher education and then communicate that, many will be out of business soon as our youth chose trade schools. 43% of generation z leans conservative, up 20% from millineals when they were 18-23",
